- 👋 Hi, I’m @Shiboleth2
- 👀 I’m interested in a code of conduct that applies equally among all participants of the web; not only how site users must toe the mark but also and equally how users may expect the same tenets by websites, hosts, platforms, educators, instructors and companies  who hold our security and safety in their palms. a powerful responsibilty. which intenet sites and foundations are up to weilding the power properly?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate as the average Joe in aiding tech companies in understanding what is needed in the industry and presenting it in non-code writing terms to facilitate better understanding of the daily evolving, ever complicaed world. To help integrate the many fantastic developments in a non frightening manner so more can be involved to their own level of comfort in a technical world seemingly spinning too fast and into unknown realms. 
- Having been thrown in the deep end of the pool and expected to swim, l have discovered after 70 years that few are willing to toss the life jacket or grab the hook.  Just an analogy for discovering that the touted privacy and security of your data claims are pipe dreams in print. my iphone 11pro has been in my possession every day since purchased. l used triple authentication sign in: facial biometrics, passcode & password.No social media, location, sharing, ran privacy checks and updated as required.  l got hacked. invaded by pirates armed with a strange language of mixed letters/numbers like a toddler dumped his blocks and made a random new verse.  how? why?  To keep from drowning l went on a prlgrimage for answers, this being one stop on an unfinished trek. l write this entry on a cheap burner, my $1300 phone was 'kented'.  l could hold it but not use it.  I was shut out of my own phone even as I held it. No doubt some of you know me very well
